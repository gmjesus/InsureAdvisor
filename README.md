Problem Statement: How can an insurance company connect to customers more directly? 

## Inspiration

In today's society, it is very difficult for insurance companies to connect with customers directly. Since everything is online now, so there is less direct communication between the clients and companies.

## What it does

We created an algorithm that matches insurance brokers with people who are seeking specialized insurance packages within their price ranges. 

## How we built it

We created a REST API with NodeJS and ExpressJS connecting it with a MongoDB Cloud Database. We used ReactJS for the frontend. 

## Challenges we ran into

Coming up with the idea to solve this problem and trying to implement other 3rd party APIs.
